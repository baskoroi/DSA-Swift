# DSA-Swift

Basically my collection of commonly-known data structures &amp; algorithms, implemented in Swift playgrounds only for learning purposes.

I also have personal Leetcode & scrap pages here, again for learning & exercises.

## Resources

- O'Reilly Online Learning: "Learning Data Structures and Algorithms" -- really recommended for guys allergic to CLRS, yet need detailed and understandable English-only explanations.
    - Videos keep me from the temptation of playing music and disrupting my concentration.
